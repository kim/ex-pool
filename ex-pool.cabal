synopsis:
  Another fork of resource-pool, with a MonadIO and MonadCatch constraint

description:
  A fork of 'resource-pool' using 'MonadIO' and 'exceptions'.
  .
  The library also contains a number of fixes and enhancements which are not yet
  included in a Hackage release of the original library. Apart from that, this
  library is a drop-in replacement for 'resource-pool', useful in cases where a
  more general monadic type is desirable.
